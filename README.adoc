WARNING: tst.lua will not run correctly if you do not set environment variables
         in config.ps1 correctly

change `$env:LUA_DEV` in config.ps1 to the location of your lua exeutable and
lua _.lib_ file (here I am assuming they are in the same location). change
`$env:LUA_INC` to the path of your lua include files

In the Developer Powershell command promt run

[source, ps1]
----
.\config.ps1
----

then run

[source, ps1]
----
nmake.exe -f .\Makefile.win
----

== Runing the program

execute like this. This example assumes your lua executable is named `lua`.

[source, ps1]
----
.\lua tst.lua
